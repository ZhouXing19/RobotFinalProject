## Motivation

We will explore the collaboration/competition of two robots to finish tasks in a room in a specific order as fast as possible, so that they will be let out of the room. Each task can only be finished by one robot. This will involve some fun designs of the room, different customized tasks, and also the interaction of robots.

## Instruction (demo)

0. `git clone` or `git pull`, then `cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make` 
   
1. In terminal: **(Don't forget to `cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make` for each new terminal window)**

```
(1st window) $ roscore
(2st window) $ roslaunch escapebots sing_demo.launch
(3nd window) $ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_moveit_config move_group.launch
(Wait until you see "You can start planning now!!")
(4th window) $ rosrun escapebots demopickup.py
```

## Project Description

### Goal

### Main Components

## System Architecture

### Matrices
We created 3 matrices, states, action-matrix and actions, all located in the action_states folder. The states matrix represents all 128 (2^7) states that our world can be in.  This was created by writing a function that computes all the possible permutations of a list, and then running it on each of the lists `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [1,0,0,0,0,0,0],… [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`, to generate all possible combinations of the objects and their values. The actions matrix represents the 7 actions we are allowed to take; each of the 7 objects is allowed to be moved to its final position (represented by the value 1). This was manually written due to its simplicity. The action-matrix matrix represents each of the 128 possible states and the valid states that can be reached from that state. This was computed by first creating an empty 128x128 matrix. Then each state was compared to every other state, and if there was only one difference, and that difference represented one of the actions being completed, not undone, the location of this action was recorded. To further filter these possible actions, the action was checked against the state of the world to make sure that the action was valid at the time. For example, the yellow door could only be closed if the animals had already been moved. If these conditions weren’t true, the value was changed back to -1, if it was, this action was recorded as a valid action that could move state A to state B. This was coded through a series of loops and if/else statements and then output into the right format.


### Algorithm
The main robotics algorithm we were looking to implement is Nash Q-Learning, which is a kind of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm. Nash Q-Learning works by establishing a Nash equilibrium strategy among all learning agents such that each agent's actions are the best response to any other agent's action. 

We wanted to implement a fully cooperative version of Nash Q-Learning, where all robots intend to maximize the common reward. To do so, we used a common fully cooperative multi-agent Q-Learning implementation, wherein each robot maintains its own Q-function and Q-matrix. In the update for each robot's Q-function, it differs slightly from single-agent Q-Learning in that the robot accounts for the other robot's Q-values and Nash equilibrium strategy. The general equation is as follows:

`Q(s, a1, ... ,aN) = (1 - alpha) * Q(s, a1) + alpha * (reward + gamma * Nash(s', q1, ..., qN))`

where alpha = learning rate, gamma = discount factor, and aN = the Q-value of robot N at state s.

We used a modified version of the Nash Q-value (Nash(s', a1, ..., aN)) since our robots are fully collaborative. We set `Nash(s', a1, ..., aN))` equal to the maximum Q-value derived across all learning agents -- in our case, since we only have two robots, the maximum Q-value across both robots. This new Nash Q-value is a slight spinoff of the Q-value used in the Minimax algorithm, which is another Q-Learning algorithm for competitive MARL. 

Since we use a learning rate of 1, the algorithm distills down to a much simpler version that resembles single-agent Q-Learning. This should be the case, as the MARL we use should be somewhat similar to the single-agent learning given that our robots must be fully cooperative.

### Code Location
Essentially all of the code for our MARL algorithm and functions can be found in the `q_learning_training.py`. The `update_q_matrix()` function is particularly important, as it is the epicenter of the algorithm's execution.

## Challenges
We were happy with our project but there were definitely a lot of parts that didn’t go according to plan. A lot of our future work would be focused on fixing these issues by looking into alternate approaches and designs that might allow us to fully implement our original idea. For example, we would really like to have our robots simultaneously completing tasks in the same room. Additionally, future work could include making our world and objectives more complex, which would then affect the Q-Learning portion. By adding more sets of rules and additional challenges to the game, we could look into other Q-Learning algorithms that might fit this model more. There is a lot of space for us to expand on our current idea, and both fixing our issues with simultaneous robot movement and adding more components to our world would be a great place to start.
## Future Work

## Takeaways
- Controlling multiple robots in the same world can be very challenging 
- Integrating multiple kinematics files together requires extra launch-files, so it is good to plan ahead for how to combine all parts of the project
- Using the robot gripper with objects that aren’t very simple shapes provides a lot of extra challenges
